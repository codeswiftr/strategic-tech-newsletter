Key insights:
• **ETL Mindset:** "Pull data from sources every night, transform it, load it into the warehouse."
• **Event-Driven Mindset:** "Every state change is an event. Publish it immediately. Let consumers react in real-time."
• **Producers** publish events to a streaming platform when things happen (user signup, order placed, sensor reading)
• **Stream processors** transform events in-flight (enrich with user data, aggregate metrics, detect anomalies)
• **Consumers** subscribe to event streams and react (update search indices, trigger notifications, feed ML models)
