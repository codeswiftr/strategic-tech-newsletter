Market Insight: The $200B Cloud Waste Problem

In February 2025, a Fortune 500 retail company's board meeting derailed spectacularly.

Key insights:
• CFOs are treating cloud spend like a compliance failure, demanding the same rigor as financial audits
• Boards are asking pointed questions about cloud ROI that CTOs struggle to answer
• Cloud cost overruns are appearing in earnings calls as margin pressure explanations
• FinOps has gone from nice-to-have to executive-mandated in 18 months
• Development environments running 24/7 despite 40-hour work weeks
