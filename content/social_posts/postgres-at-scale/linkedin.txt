Postgres at Massive Scale: The Production Lessons Nobody Teaches You

Your Postgres database just crossed 2TB. Query latencies are creeping up. Connection counts are approaching limits. Your VP Engineering is in your office asking the question every infrastructure lead dreads: "Do we need to migrate to a distributed database?"

Key insights:
• AWS RDS db.r7g.16xlarge (512GB RAM, 64 vCPUs): ~$6,500/month
• Distributed database migration (engineering time, new infrastructure, operational complexity): $500,000+ and 6-12 months
• Years of runway before vertical scaling caps out: 2-4 years for typical growth trajectories
• Your largest available instance can't fit your working set in memory
• Single-threaded write bottlenecks (Postgres has limits on write parallelism)
