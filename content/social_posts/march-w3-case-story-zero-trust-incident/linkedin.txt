Key insights:
• **Build System Lockout:** Deployment pipelines couldn't authenticate to artifact repositories. The fix for the outage couldn't be deployed.
• **Monitoring Blind Spots:** Observability agents lost access to metrics endpoints. They were flying blind during the crisis.
• **Database Access Revocation:** Connection pooling libraries cached credentials for 4 hours, but Zero Trust revoked them every 30 minutes. When pools refreshed, they hit the overloaded policy engine and failed.
