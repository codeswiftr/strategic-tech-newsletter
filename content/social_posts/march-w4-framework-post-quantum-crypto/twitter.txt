Post-Quantum Cryptography Roadmap: What Engineering Teams Must Do Before 2030

A thread 🧵👇

==================================================

Tweet 2/8:
The cryptographic foundations of modern internet security are on a countdown to obsolescence. Within the next decade, sufficiently powerful quantum computers will break the RSA, ECC, and Diffie-Hellman encryption that secures everything from HTTPS connections to financi...

1/ **2025-2027**: Quantum computers reach 1,000+ logical qubits, capable of breaking 1024-bit RSA in laboratory conditions

==================================================

Tweet 4/8:
2/ **2028-2030**: Cloud-accessible quantum computing makes cryptanalysis economically viable for nation-states

==================================================

Tweet 5/8:
3/ **2030-2035**: Widespread quantum capability enables routine decryption of previously captured encrypted traffic
