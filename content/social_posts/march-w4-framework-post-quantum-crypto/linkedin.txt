Post-Quantum Cryptography Roadmap: What Engineering Teams Must Do Before 2030

The cryptographic foundations of modern internet security are on a countdown to obsolescence. Within the next decade, sufficiently powerful quantum computers will break the RSA, ECC, and Diffie-Hellman encryption that secures everything from HTTPS connections to financial transactions to government 

Key insights:
• **2025-2027**: Quantum computers reach 1,000+ logical qubits, capable of breaking 1024-bit RSA in laboratory conditions
• **2028-2030**: Cloud-accessible quantum computing makes cryptanalysis economically viable for nation-states
• **2030-2035**: Widespread quantum capability enables routine decryption of previously captured encrypted traffic
• Conduct crypto inventory across entire stack (applications, infrastructure, embedded systems)
• Establish crypto agility principles in new development
