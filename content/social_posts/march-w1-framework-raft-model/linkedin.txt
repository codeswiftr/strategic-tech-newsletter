The RAFT Model for Multi-Agent AI Systems: A Framework for Production-Ready Autonomous Systems

**Framework Breakdown | Week 1, March 2025**

Key insights:
• **Data staleness**: Agent A decides to approve a transaction while Agent B simultaneously flags the account as fraudulent
• **Cascade failures**: One agent timeout causes 12 downstream agents to fail, each with different error messages
• **Debugging nightmares**: "Why did the system make this decision?" requires 6 engineers, 4 hours, and access to 9 different log streams
• **Brittle recovery**: Systems get stuck in weird states after failures, requiring manual intervention
• All state changes are events appended to an immutable log (e.g., Apache Kafka, EventStoreDB)
