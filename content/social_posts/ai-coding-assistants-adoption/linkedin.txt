Beyond the Hype: What 40% Adoption of AI Coding Assistants Actually Means for Engineering Teams

You're reviewing Q3 budget proposals when a familiar request appears: "GitHub Copilot licenses for the entire engineering team - $19/month per seat." Simple math says that's $456 per engineer annually. For a 50-person team, you're looking at $22,800 before considering training time, workflow changes

Key insights:
• **Boilerplate and scaffolding**: Significant gains (writing CRUD endpoints, setting up project structure)
• **API exploration**: Moderate gains (discovering library methods, understanding SDKs)
• **Test generation**: Moderate gains (creating unit test templates)
• **Refactoring**: Modest gains (renaming variables, restructuring code)
• **Complex debugging**: Minimal gains (sometimes slower due to suggestion distraction)
