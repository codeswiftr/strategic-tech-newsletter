# Week 1: The Agentic Coding Revolution - Essay Outline

## Working Title
"From Solo Developer to Agent Orchestra Conductor: The Agentic Coding Revolution"

## Target Audience
- Senior developers transitioning to AI-assisted workflows
- Engineering leaders evaluating agentic development adoption
- Tech leads building AI-enhanced development teams
- CTOs planning 2025 development strategy

## Hook (150-200 words)
**Scenario**: You're a senior developer with 15 years of experience. You can write a REST API in your sleep, debug race conditions with your eyes closed, and refactor legacy code without breaking a sweat. Then you try GitHub Copilot's new Agent Mode, and it writes an entire feature—tests included—in 6 minutes while you watch.

**Key tension**: Your identity as a developer is shifting from "person who writes code" to "person who orchestrates agents that write code." It's exhilarating and terrifying in equal measure.

**Why now**: The agentic coding revolution isn't coming—it's here. 84% of developers already use or plan to use AI tools. Replit went from $10M to $100M ARR in 9 months on the back of their AI agent. The question isn't "Will this change development?" but "How do I adapt before I'm left behind?"

## Structure
